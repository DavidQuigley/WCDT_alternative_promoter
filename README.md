## Obtaining this study's raw data

### Data generated by this collaboration

The RNA sequence data generated in this study will be available at the time of publication 
from the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA) at accession EGAS00001006275.

Previously published whole genome DNA sequencing and whole genome bisulfite sequencing data 
for the WCDT mCRPC cohort used in this study are available on dbGaP with study number phs001648 
and at the GDC under study WCDT_mCRPC. Access to these data at both of these repositories 
(dbGaP and the GDC) must be requested through dbGaP.

### Data generated by other groups and used in this study

Publicly available RNA sequencing data for benign prostate tissue and localized prostate tumors in the 
PAIR cohort are available from GEO at GSE115414.

Public RNA sequencing datra for localized prostate cancer biopsies in the CPCG cohort can 
be downloaded from the EGA at EGAD00001004424.

Public RNA sequencing data for shFOXA1 and control LNCaP cells are available at the GEO 
repository at GSE119757.
